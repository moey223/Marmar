I've started loving life because of you; I've started wanting to live because of you. You've been my greatest blessing and the most precious gem I have. I could keep yapping about how amazing you are until morning, but I'll keep it shortâ€”I love you, Anmar. I love you more than I've ever loved any other girl in my entire life. I've never felt so happy in someone's presence, and I've never felt that someone was as worthy of my care and attention as you are. Your eyes are so capable of turning me from this nervous and sad boy into a happy one. I've never been so thankful to have someone in my life and I hope i can be better for you. I'm sorry for being such a pain in your ass lately for that i apologize,  I'd love to be your man from October 27, 2024, until our last days on this Earth. From the bottom of my heart, I love you and Happy Valentine's Day.";
